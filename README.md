Data Science For The Wild Dolphin Project

This is a collection of scripts to build and analyze dolphin communication models
and communicate the results with domain experts. 

## Contents

+ 1) `app`: "Wild Dolphin Project Data Science Platform" google cloud 
+ 2) `ml`: Training and Evaluation of Machine Learning Models
+ 3) `models`: The models with a small report on their performance
+ 4) `scripts`: Collection of scripts that keep the project alive

## Results So Far

The best model I could come up with is an lstm/convnet based encoder
decoder architecture trained as an auto encoder. Can be found in model
`v4.1` and `v4.3`
