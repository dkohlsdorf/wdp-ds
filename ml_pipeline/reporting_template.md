## 1) Model Architecture    
The encoder that is used to extract features from the audio windows:
```
<ENCODER>
```
    
The complete auto encoder for unsupervised training:
```
<AUTO_ENCODER>
```
    
Silence detector:
```
<SIL>
```     

## 2) Feature Extraction
The parameters to extract the features from the audio files are listed in the table below:    
<PARAMS>
    
## 3) Classification Experiment
